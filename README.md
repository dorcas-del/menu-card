# Menu-card project
This is a simple and responsive menu card for restaurants I replicated and coded. It shows an omelette dish, 
recipe instructions, and nutritional information in a stripped down layout.

## What it includes
- Title and description of a dish
- An image of the food
- A short recipe
- A nutrition facts section

## Tools used
- Figma for design
- HTML and CSS for coding

## How to view it
Just open the index.html file in your browser and that's it

## File structure
- index.html - the main code file
- styles.css - the styling
- images/' -folder for food images
- READ.ME - this file
